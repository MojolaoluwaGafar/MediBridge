# API contract

The API lives in `apps/api` and is mounted under `/api`. The web app reads the
server origin from `VITE_BASE_URL` and prefixes every request with `/api`.

Authenticated routes expect `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. Tokens are issued
by the auth routes and carry `{ id, role }`, where `role` is `user`, `doctor`,
or `admin`.

## Auth — `/api/auth`
